# Changelog

## 1.6.3

### 🐛 Bug Fix - Image Service Startup Logging
- **Improved error visibility**: Node.js console output now shown directly in add-on logs
  - **Previous issue**: Errors were hidden in /var/log/image-service.log
  - **Solution**: Pipe Node.js stdout/stderr directly to add-on logs with `[Image Service]` prefix
  - **Added checks**: Verify server.js and node_modules exist before starting
  - **Auto-recovery**: Attempt `npm install` if node_modules is missing
  - **Result**: All startup errors now visible in `ha addons logs`

This will help diagnose why the image service isn't starting properly.

## 1.6.2

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix - Express Route Order
- **Fixed 404 errors on API endpoints**: API routes now registered before static file middleware
  - **Root cause**: Static file middleware was placed before API routes in Express app
  - **Impact**: `/config` returned HTML instead of JSON, `/terminal` returned 404
  - **Solution**: Moved all API routes (/health, /config, /upload, /terminal) before static middleware
  - **Result**: All endpoints now work correctly

This is a common Express.js gotcha - middleware order matters! Static file middleware should come AFTER API routes to prevent it from intercepting API requests.

## 1.6.1

### 🐛 Bug Fixes - Image Paste Service
- **Fixed upload JSON parse errors**: Server now returns proper JSON error responses instead of HTML
  - **Root cause**: Multer errors were not caught, Express returned default HTML error pages
  - **Solution**: Added Multer-specific error handling middleware
  - **Impact**: Upload errors now show clear, actionable messages

- **Fixed terminal not loading through Home Assistant ingress**: Terminal now loads via proxy endpoint
  - **Root cause**: iframe tried to access ttyd on port 7681 directly, incompatible with ingress
  - **Solution**: Added http-proxy-middleware with WebSocket support, created /terminal/ proxy endpoint
  - **Impact**: Terminal works correctly through Home Assistant ingress

- **Improved paste event detection**: Better debugging and compatibility
  - Added detailed console logging for troubleshooting
  - Added window-level paste handler as fallback
  - Enhanced error handling in upload function

### 📦 Dependencies
- Added `http-proxy-middleware@^2.0.6` for WebSocket-capable terminal proxying

## 1.6.0

### ✨ New Feature - Image Paste Support
- **Paste images directly in the terminal**: Upload images via paste (Ctrl+V), drag-drop, or upload button
  - **Lightweight Node.js service**: ~10MB RAM overhead, ARM-compatible for Raspberry Pi
  - **Multiple upload methods**: Clipboard paste, drag-and-drop, or button click
  - **Persistent storage**: Images saved to `/data/images/` (survives restarts)
  - **Claude integration**: Use uploaded images with Claude Code CLI for analysis, OCR, etc.
  - **File formats**: Supports JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG (10MB limit)

- **Architecture changes**:
  - New image upload service on port 7680 (Express + Multer)
  - Custom HTML interface embeds ttyd terminal (port 7681)
  - Home Assistant ingress now points to port 7680
  - Both services run concurrently in the container

- **User experience**:
  - Copy image → Paste in terminal → Automatic upload
  - File path shown in status bar: `/data/images/pasted-<timestamp>.png`
  - Use with Claude: `analyze /data/images/pasted-123.png`

### 📚 Documentation
- Added `IMAGE_PASTE.md` with complete feature documentation
- Updated CLAUDE.md with image paste development notes
- Documented troubleshooting and browser compatibility

### 🔧 Technical Details
- Dependencies: Express (4.18.2), Multer (1.4.5-lts.1)
- Security: MIME type validation, 10MB size limit, isolated storage
- Performance: Minimal CPU usage, only active during uploads
- Compatibility: All supported architectures (amd64, aarch64, armv7)

## 1.5.2

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix - Persistent Packages PATH
- **Fixed persistent packages not available in terminal**: Packages installed via `persist-install` are now correctly available in all bash sessions
  - **Root cause**: Environment variables (PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH) were only set in parent run.sh process
  - **Solution**: Created `/etc/profile.d/persistent-packages.sh` which is auto-sourced by all bash shells
  - **Impact**: `python3`, `ha`, and other installed packages now work immediately after installation
  - **Affected versions**: 1.4.0 - 1.5.1 (packages were installed correctly but not in PATH)

- **Technical details**:
  - ttyd spawns bash sessions that don't inherit parent process environment variables
  - Standard Linux solution: Use `/etc/profile.d/` for system-wide environment configuration
  - Profile script sets HOME, XDG variables, and persistent package paths for all sessions
  - No changes needed to existing installations - automatic on container restart

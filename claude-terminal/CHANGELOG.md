# Changelog

## 1.7.5

### ✨ New Feature - Claude Home Assistant Plugins Pre-installed
- **Home Assistant plugins included in Docker image**: Plugins are now automatically installed during build
  - No manual installation required
  - `CLAUDE.md` with HA-specific context automatically created in `/config`
  - Provides Claude Code with specialized tools for Home Assistant development
  - Plugin source: [@ESJavadex/claude-homeassistant-plugins](https://github.com/ESJavadex/claude-homeassistant-plugins)

## 1.7.4

### ✨ New Feature - Git Pre-installed
- **Git version control included in base image**: Git is now pre-installed in the Docker container
  - No need to use `persist-install git` anymore
  - Available immediately on fresh installs
  - Enables version control workflows within the terminal

## 1.7.1

### ✨ Improvement - Auto-Copy & Focus for Image Uploads
- **Streamlined image workflow**: Path automatically copied and terminal focused after upload
  - **Auto-copy to clipboard**: File path instantly copied when image uploaded
  - **Auto-focus terminal**: Terminal iframe automatically focused and ready
  - **Auto-paste attempt**: Tries to paste path directly (may be blocked by browser security)
  - **Clear status**: Shows "Ready to use! (path in clipboard)"
  - **Workflow**: Upload image → Press Cmd+V → Done!
  - **Fallback**: If auto-paste blocked, just press Cmd+V (clipboard already has path)

**How it works now**:
1. Paste/drag/upload an image
2. Path is automatically copied to clipboard
3. Terminal is automatically focused
4. Just press Cmd+V to paste the path
5. Ask Claude to analyze it!

This makes the image workflow nearly seamless - you don't need to click anything after uploading!

## 1.7.0

### ✨ New Feature - Voice Input with Web Speech API
- **Talk to Claude instead of typing**: Built-in speech-to-text using Chrome's Web Speech API
  - **Press-to-talk button**: Click 🎤 Voice Input button in header
  - **Real-time transcription**: See your speech converted to text as you speak
  - **Continuous recording**: Keeps listening until you stop
  - **Editable transcript**: Edit the transcribed text before copying
  - **Copy to clipboard**: One-click copy to paste into Claude Terminal
  - **Keyboard shortcuts**:
    - `Space` - Start/stop recording
    - `Enter` - Copy transcript
    - `Escape` - Close modal
  - **Error handling**: Clear messages for microphone issues, permissions, etc.
  - **No external services**: Uses browser's built-in speech recognition (Chrome, Edge, Safari)
  - **Perfect for**: Long questions, complex queries, hands-free operation

- **How to use**:
  1. Click 🎤 Voice Input button
  2. Click "Start Recording" and speak
  3. Click "Stop Recording" when done
  4. Edit text if needed
  5. Click "Copy Text"
  6. Paste into Claude Terminal!

**Browser support**: Chrome, Edge, Safari (requires microphone permissions)

## 1.6.6

### 🐛 Bug Fix - Clipboard API in Home Assistant Ingress
- **Fixed clipboard copy in iframe context**: Added fallback methods for copying file path
  - **Root cause**: `navigator.clipboard` API is blocked in Home Assistant ingress iframes
  - **Error**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'writeText')"
  - **Solution**: Multi-tier fallback approach:
    1. Try modern Clipboard API if available
    2. Fallback to `document.execCommand('copy')` with text selection
    3. Final fallback: Select text for manual Cmd+C copy
  - **User feedback**: Shows "✓ Copied!" or "✓ Selected! Press Cmd+C to copy"
  - **Result**: Path copying now works in all contexts (direct access, ingress, iframes)

**Technical note**: Browser security restrictions prevent clipboard access in cross-origin iframes. The new implementation uses progressive enhancement to provide the best experience available in each context.

## 1.6.5

### ✨ UX Improvement - Better Path Visibility for Manual Copy
- **Enhanced upload status display**: Full file path now shown prominently with click-to-copy functionality
  - **Previous**: Only showed filename ("Uploaded: pasted-123.png")
  - **Now**: Shows full path with icon ("📋 /data/images/pasted-123.png (click to copy)")
  - **Persistent display**: Path remains visible until next upload (no auto-hide)
  - **Click-to-copy**: Click the status text to copy path to clipboard
  - **Visual feedback**: Shows "✓ Copied to clipboard!" confirmation
  - **Fallback**: If clipboard API fails, shows error and allows manual selection
  - **User-friendly**: Hover effect and cursor pointer indicate clickability

This improvement addresses the issue where users couldn't easily see or copy the full file path to manually paste into Claude Code CLI.

## 1.6.4

### 🐛 Critical Fix - Home Assistant Ingress Compatibility
- **Fixed 404 errors and config loading failures**: Changed all paths to relative for ingress compatibility
  - **Root cause**: Absolute paths (`/config`, `/terminal/`, `/upload`) don't work with Home Assistant ingress
  - **Impact**: All API endpoints returned 404, terminal wouldn't load, uploads failed
  - **Solution**: Changed to relative paths (`config`, `terminal/`, `upload`)
  - **Why**: Home Assistant ingress adds path prefix `/api/hassio_ingress/TOKEN/` to all requests
  - **Result**: All features now work correctly through Home Assistant ingress

**Technical note**: This is a common Home Assistant add-on issue. When using ingress, all fetch calls and iframe sources must use relative paths (without leading `/`) to work correctly with the ingress path prefix.

## 1.6.3

### 🐛 Bug Fix - Image Service Startup Logging
- **Improved error visibility**: Node.js console output now shown directly in add-on logs
  - **Previous issue**: Errors were hidden in /var/log/image-service.log
  - **Solution**: Pipe Node.js stdout/stderr directly to add-on logs with `[Image Service]` prefix
  - **Added checks**: Verify server.js and node_modules exist before starting
  - **Auto-recovery**: Attempt `npm install` if node_modules is missing
  - **Result**: All startup errors now visible in `ha addons logs`

This will help diagnose why the image service isn't starting properly.

## 1.6.2

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix - Express Route Order
- **Fixed 404 errors on API endpoints**: API routes now registered before static file middleware
  - **Root cause**: Static file middleware was placed before API routes in Express app
  - **Impact**: `/config` returned HTML instead of JSON, `/terminal` returned 404
  - **Solution**: Moved all API routes (/health, /config, /upload, /terminal) before static middleware
  - **Result**: All endpoints now work correctly

This is a common Express.js gotcha - middleware order matters! Static file middleware should come AFTER API routes to prevent it from intercepting API requests.

## 1.6.1

### 🐛 Bug Fixes - Image Paste Service
- **Fixed upload JSON parse errors**: Server now returns proper JSON error responses instead of HTML
  - **Root cause**: Multer errors were not caught, Express returned default HTML error pages
  - **Solution**: Added Multer-specific error handling middleware
  - **Impact**: Upload errors now show clear, actionable messages

- **Fixed terminal not loading through Home Assistant ingress**: Terminal now loads via proxy endpoint
  - **Root cause**: iframe tried to access ttyd on port 7681 directly, incompatible with ingress
  - **Solution**: Added http-proxy-middleware with WebSocket support, created /terminal/ proxy endpoint
  - **Impact**: Terminal works correctly through Home Assistant ingress

- **Improved paste event detection**: Better debugging and compatibility
  - Added detailed console logging for troubleshooting
  - Added window-level paste handler as fallback
  - Enhanced error handling in upload function

### 📦 Dependencies
- Added `http-proxy-middleware@^2.0.6` for WebSocket-capable terminal proxying

## 1.6.0

### ✨ New Feature - Image Paste Support
- **Paste images directly in the terminal**: Upload images via paste (Ctrl+V), drag-drop, or upload button
  - **Lightweight Node.js service**: ~10MB RAM overhead, ARM-compatible for Raspberry Pi
  - **Multiple upload methods**: Clipboard paste, drag-and-drop, or button click
  - **Persistent storage**: Images saved to `/data/images/` (survives restarts)
  - **Claude integration**: Use uploaded images with Claude Code CLI for analysis, OCR, etc.
  - **File formats**: Supports JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG (10MB limit)

- **Architecture changes**:
  - New image upload service on port 7680 (Express + Multer)
  - Custom HTML interface embeds ttyd terminal (port 7681)
  - Home Assistant ingress now points to port 7680
  - Both services run concurrently in the container

- **User experience**:
  - Copy image → Paste in terminal → Automatic upload
  - File path shown in status bar: `/data/images/pasted-<timestamp>.png`
  - Use with Claude: `analyze /data/images/pasted-123.png`

### 📚 Documentation
- Added `IMAGE_PASTE.md` with complete feature documentation
- Updated CLAUDE.md with image paste development notes
- Documented troubleshooting and browser compatibility

### 🔧 Technical Details

- Security: MIME type validation, 10MB size limit, isolated storage
- Performance: Minimal CPU usage, only active during uploads
- Compatibility: All supported architectures (amd64, aarch64, armv7)

## 1.5.2

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix - Persistent Packages PATH
- **Fixed persistent packages not available in terminal**: Packages installed via `persist-install` are now correctly available in all bash sessions
  - **Root cause**: Environment variables (PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH) were only set in parent run.sh process
  - **Solution**: Created `/etc/profile.d/persistent-packages.sh` which is auto-sourced by all bash shells
  - **Impact**: `python3`, `ha`, and other installed packages now work immediately after installation
  - **Affected versions**: 1.4.0 - 1.5.1 (packages were installed correctly but not in PATH)

- **Technical details**:
  - ttyd spawns bash sessions that don't inherit parent process environment variables
  - Standard Linux solution: Use `/etc/profile.d/` for system-wide environment configuration
  - Profile script sets HOME, XDG variables, and persistent package paths for all sessions
  - No changes needed to existing installations - automatic on container restart

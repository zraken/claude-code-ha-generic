## Security Considerations

Claude Terminal is designed with security in mind:

- The add-on runs in an isolated container
- Your code and queries go directly to Anthropic's API
- OAuth authentication ensures secure access to your account

To further enhance security:
- Log out when not actively using the terminal
- Monitor the add-on logs for unusual activity
- Keep your Anthropic account secure with a strong password

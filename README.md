# Claude Terminal Pro for Home Assistant

An enhanced Home Assistant add-on that integrates Anthropic's Claude Code CLI with persistent package management and advanced features.

## Recommended Plugins

For an enhanced Claude Code experience with Home Assistant, we recommend installing the **Claude Home Assistant Plugins**:

**[https://github.com/ESJavadex/claude-homeassistant-plugins](https://github.com/ESJavadex/claude-homeassistant-plugins)**

These plugins provide Claude Code with specialized tools and context for Home Assistant development, including entity management, automation helpers, and more.

### Installation

Run this command inside Claude Terminal Pro:

```bash
npx claude-plugins install @ESJavadex/claude-homeassistant-plugins/homeassistant-config

This creates a `CLAUDE.md` file in your Home Assistant config directory with context and instructions tailored for Home Assistant development.
